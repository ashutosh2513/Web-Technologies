    <h1>Farm Bill 2020</h1>
    <img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2021/04/farmers-protest-pti-22-1617454042.jpg" alt="farmers protest" height="350px" width="500px">
    <p>The government has described these <mark>Farm bills</mark> as giving new freedom to farmers after independence.
         According to the <b>government</b>, the farmers will be empowered by these bills and will be able to enter into agreements with <del>multinational companies, big traders</del>, etc.
        
        According to the new <i>Farm bill</i> 2020, the farmer can sell his crop in any market at the <em>desired price</em>. With this, farmers will get better options to sell their produce.
        
        Earlier middlemen used to acquire a major part of the farmers’ income, but now farmers will get freedom from them.</p>

        
        <p>The new system will <ins>eliminate the compulsion</ins> of the <strong>farmers</strong> to go to the mandi and sell their products to the licensed traders and now the farmer will be the owner of his will.

            That is, the producers will get more freedom by preparing the private market, whether the producers go to the <sup>APMC</sup> market or the private market. This will boost the thinking of <mark>“one nation one agricultural market"</mark>.
            
            By bringing contract farming under <sub>legal</sub> purview, producers will be able to get a ready market for their product and entrepreneurs will get ready raw material. Because in contract farming it is decided long before that what to produce and what will be the price. In such a situation, producers will not have to bear the risk of market fluctuations.</p>
